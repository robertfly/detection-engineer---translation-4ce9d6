## Introduction

Welcome to the AI-Driven Detection Translation Platform contribution guidelines. This document outlines our enterprise-grade development process with a strong emphasis on security, code quality, and maintainability. We appreciate your interest in contributing and ask that you follow these guidelines to ensure a secure and efficient collaboration.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors must adhere to our Code of Conduct (see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Any security implications or concerns should be reported following our security reporting procedures.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Git 2.x+
- Node.js 20.x
- Python 3.11
- Go 1.21
- Docker 24.x+
- Security scanning tools (latest versions)

### Environment Setup Steps

1. **Clone and Verify Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/detection-translation-platform.git
   cd detection-translation-platform
   git verify-commit HEAD
   ```

2. **Configure Git Security**
   ```bash
   git config --global commit.gpgsign true
   git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_GPG_KEY
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies with Security Audit**
   ```bash
   # Node.js dependencies
   npm install --audit
   
   # Python dependencies
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   safety check
   
   # Go dependencies
   go mod download
   go mod verify
   ```

4. **Configure Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
   ```

5. **Set Up Security Tools**
   ```bash
   # Install security scanning tools
   npm install -g snyk
   pip install bandit
   go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- Main Branches:
  - `main` - Production releases
  - `develop` - Development integration
  - `release/*` - Release candidates

- Feature Branches:
  - `feature/*` - New features
  - `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
  - `hotfix/*` - Critical fixes
  - `security/*` - Security updates

### Creating a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Commit Guidelines
1. Use signed commits
   ```bash
   git commit -S -m "feat: Add secure feature description"
   ```

2. Follow conventional commit format:
   - `feat:` - New features
   - `fix:` - Bug fixes
   - `security:` - Security updates
   - `docs:` - Documentation
   - `test:` - Tests
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring

### Pull Request Process

1. **Pre-submission Checklist**
   - [ ] Run full test suite with minimum 90% coverage
   - [ ] Execute security scans (Snyk, SonarQube, Trivy)
   - [ ] Update security documentation if needed
   - [ ] Verify all commits are signed
   - [ ] Complete security checklist in PR template

2. **Required Reviews**
   - Code owner approval
   - Security team review for sensitive areas:
     - `/api/*`
     - `/auth/*`
     - `/detection/*`

## Code Standards

### General Guidelines
- Write self-documenting code with clear security implications
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Follow language-specific style guides:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: ESLint with security rules
  - Python: Black formatter + Bandit security checks
  - Go: gofmt + gosec security checks

### Documentation Requirements
- Clear security considerations in comments
- Updated API documentation with security notes
- Comprehensive test coverage documentation

### Testing Standards
- Minimum 90% code coverage
- Security-focused test cases
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Performance testing for critical paths

## Security Guidelines

### Code Security
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Output encoding for all responses
- Secure error handling without information leakage
- Proper secret management
- Regular dependency updates

### API Security
- Authentication for all endpoints
- Rate limiting implementation
- Input sanitization
- CORS policy compliance
- Security headers configuration

### Data Handling
- Encryption for sensitive data
- Secure logging practices
- PII handling compliance
- Data retention policies
- Access control implementation

## Review Process

### Code Review Requirements
1. **Security Review**
   - Authentication/Authorization checks
   - Input validation verification
   - Secure data handling
   - Dependency security
   - API security compliance

2. **Technical Review**
   - Code quality standards
   - Test coverage requirements
   - Performance implications
   - Documentation completeness

3. **Final Verification**
   - Security scan results
   - Integration test results
   - Documentation updates
   - Deployment considerations

### Review Response
- Address all security feedback promptly
- Document security-related changes
- Update tests for security fixes
- Verify fixes with security tools
