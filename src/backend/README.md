## Overview

The Detection Translation Platform backend is a microservices-based system designed to provide high-performance, secure, and scalable detection translation capabilities. The system leverages custom-trained GenAI models to automate the translation of security detections between major SIEM platforms and detection languages.

### Key Features
- Automated detection translation between multiple formats
- High-fidelity translation with >95% accuracy
- Secure API gateway with robust authentication
- Scalable microservices architecture
- Comprehensive validation and error reporting
- GitHub integration for detection management

### Supported Formats
- Splunk SPL
- QRadar AQL
- SIGMA
- Microsoft Azure KQL
- Palo Alto Networks
- Crowdstrike NG-SIEM
- YARA
- YARA-L

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The backend system follows a microservices architecture pattern with the following core components:

    A[API Gateway] --> B[Translation Service]
    A --> C[Validation Service]
    B --> D[GenAI Service]
    B --> E[Document Store]
    C --> F[Rules Engine]
    A --> G[Cache Layer]
```

### Service Communication
- REST APIs for client communication
- gRPC for inter-service communication
- RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing
- Redis for caching and rate limiting

### Data Flow
1. Client requests received through API Gateway
2. Authentication and authorization validation
3. Request routing to appropriate service
4. Translation/validation processing
5. Result storage and caching
6. Response returned to client

## Services

### API Gateway Service
Node.js-based service handling:
- Request routing and load balancing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- API documentation (OpenAPI)

[API Gateway Documentation](./api-gateway/README.md)

### Translation Service
Python-based service providing:
- Detection format parsing
- GenAI model integration
- Translation processing
- Result validation
- Batch processing

[Translation Service Documentation](./translation-service/README.md)

### Validation Service
Go-based service offering:
- Rule syntax validation
- Format-specific verification
- Performance analysis
- Compatibility checking
- Error reporting

[Validation Service Documentation](./validation-service/README.md)

## Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect support
- API key management
- MFA for administrative access

### Data Security
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- AES-256 encryption at rest
- Secure key management via AWS KMS
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with SOC 2 Type II

### Security Monitoring
- Real-time threat detection
- Anomaly detection
- Audit logging
- Security event alerting
- Incident response procedures

## Deployment

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Kubernetes 1.28+
- AWS EKS for container orchestration
