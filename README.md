## Description

The AI-Driven Detection Translation Platform is an enterprise-grade solution designed to automate the complex process of translating security detections between different SIEM platforms and detection languages. Leveraging custom-trained GenAI models, this platform significantly reduces the time and effort required for detection rule migration while maintaining high accuracy and providing detailed validation feedback.

### Overview
- Production-ready web-based system for security detection translation
- Custom AI models optimized for security detection formats
- Enterprise-focused architecture with comprehensive security controls
- Extensive validation and error reporting capabilities

### Key Features
- Single and batch detection translation processing
- GitHub integration for detection rule management
- Support for major SIEM platforms and detection formats
- Advanced validation and error reporting system
- RESTful API for seamless integration
- Comprehensive audit logging and monitoring

### Supported Platforms
